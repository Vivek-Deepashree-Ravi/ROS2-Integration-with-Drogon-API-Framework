ROS2 Integration with Drogon API Framework

üöÄ Introduction

This project demonstrates an innovative integration between ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) and Drogon, a high-performance, modern C++ web framework. By seamlessly connecting ROS2 nodes with web APIs, this solution enables both publishing and subscribing functionalities through a scalable and efficient interface.

üåü Key Features

Real-time Communication: Effortlessly expose and control ROS2 topics via RESTful APIs.

Publisher Node: Accepts HTTP POST requests to publish messages to a ROS2 topic.

Subscriber Node: Provides access to the latest messages from a ROS2 topic via an HTTP GET endpoint.

Thread-safe Multi-threading: Ensures responsive handling of concurrent API requests.

Highly Scalable Design: Easily extendable for more complex robot communication workflows.

üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

Publisher API: Handles incoming requests to publish messages to ROS2 topics.

Subscriber API: Returns the latest received message from a ROS2 topic.

Thread-safe ROS2 Communication: Separate execution threads for ROS2 spinning operations.

üöÄ Usage Instructions

Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

ROS2 Humble

Drogon Framework

Install Drogon Framework

To install Drogon on Ubuntu:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake g++ uuid-dev openssl libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon.git
cd drogon
mkdir build

cmake ..
make
sudo make install

Clone the Repository

git clone <repository-link>
cd ros2-drogon-api

Build the Project

colcon build

Running the Nodes

Start the Publisher Node:

ros2 run <package_name> publisher_node

Start the Subscriber Node:

ros2 run <package_name> subscriber_node

API Usage

Publish a Message

Endpoint: POST /publish

Body: { "message": "Hello, ROS2!" }

Get Latest Message

Endpoint: GET /latest_message

Example Requests

Publish a Message

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"message": "Hello, ROS2!"}' http://localhost:8080/publish

Retrieve Latest Message

curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/latest_message

ü§ñ Applications

Remote robot control using web APIs.

Bridging robotics systems with external cloud applications.

IoT integration for real-time monitoring.

üèÜ Highlights

This project may be one of the first demonstrations of integrating ROS2 with Drogon to unlock advanced robotic communication capabilities. With the combination of ROS2's robotics power and Drogon's high-performance API design, it lays a foundation for exciting new possibilities in automation.
